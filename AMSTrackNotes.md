### Comparison to StreetView
* Higher definition
* Up to 1 per foot, vs 50 foot w/Google
* Can move as video
* Can measure inside images
* Seamless integration w/ArcMap
* Can project line work into images

### Snohomish County
* Data collection ran July 2012 - August 2012
* Drove 2600mi
* Net 1500mi road
* ~8mil images
* 317,000 features mapped
* Final Delivery Dec 2013
* 4 terabytes of images

### Plan for Implementation and Maintenance
*

* Lane stripers

### Conceptual Consumables
* Customer Service
* Work planning

### Location Analytics: starting point
* Starting point is a sql view
