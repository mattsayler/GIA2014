### Missions
* COA's
* team of 6
    * 2 private pilot license
    * all ground school
    * FAA Class II med.
* Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico

### Vegetation Classification
* Object-based image analysis (OBIA) WF: eCognition
* Rapid delineation of shrubs using OBIA



## UAS Airframes, Capabilities, and Operations

### About
* Clackamas
* Currently most experienced w/photography

### Types of Airframes
* VTOL
* Fixed wing
* Misc
    * Tethered
    * Blimps

### Picking a platform
* Airframe depends on needs and budget
* 3-5cm average accuracy
* Civilian
    * cheaper
    * easier to use
    * shorter flight time than milspec
    * smaller payload

### Most anticipated uses
* Real Estate COmmercail planning
* Aerial surveys and mapping
* Spec. airial filming
* Search and rescue
* Aerial thermal scanning
* Accident reconstruction
* Damage assessment

### State of the Art Tech
* Multi-Spectral LiDAR
* Higher Density LiDAR
* New Kinds of Lidar
* System Miniaturization
* Image Processing
* UAS w/ 300 degree of view!
* 100g, 7-band, 7cm multi-spectral sensors!

### UAS Categories
* High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE)
* Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE)
* Low Altitude Long Endurance (LALE)
* Low Altitude Short Endurance (LASE)

### Traditional Systems vs UAS
* Markets overlap, compliment each other
* (Slides w/Matrix)
 
## Panel Discussion

* What's typical area that can be covered by small systems?
    * Airframe dependent
* Class G airspace is pseudo FAA limit ATI goes by for practicality
    * Avoid having to get higher end pilot licenses
